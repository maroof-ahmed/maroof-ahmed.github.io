Using this unique idea we software developers decided to manage an application through which one can be connected to the information of drone strikes of some common droned countries like Pakistan, Yemen and Somaliya and that anyone can get online information about the strikes in these countries. Strikes also include some covert data i.e data that is not or less openly acknowleged or displayed by news channels.<p class="mar-top-20">Before 9/11, the United States had only a tiny number of experimental drones that were never used in combat. The 9/11 attacks and the wars they engendered changed this. Today there are more than 7,000 American drones, some 200 of which are armed and which have killed thousands of people. But the virtual monopoly on drones that the US once enjoyed is long gone. According to data collected by New America, there are 86 countries that have some sort of drone capability, both armed and unarmed.</p></h4></div><!--<div class="row marketing">--><!--<div class="col-lg-6">--><!--<h3>About</h3>--><!--</div>--><!--</div>--></section>
